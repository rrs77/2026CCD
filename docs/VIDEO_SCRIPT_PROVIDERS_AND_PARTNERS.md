# Video script: Creative Curriculum Designer — for providers, training & resource companies

**Tone:** Relaxed, conversational (you know the viewer). Show the product; don’t oversell.  
**Goal:** Explain what the platform does, the free + packs model, key features, and how much can be customised.

---

## 1. Opening (30–45 sec)

**On screen:** Login or home screen.

*“Hi — I wanted to show you the Creative Curriculum Designer properly. It’s the platform we use for planning and delivering sessions, and it’s something you could use with your own teams or offer to the people you work with. I’ll keep it relaxed and just walk through what it can do.”*

**Key message:** This is for providers, training companies, and resource companies — to use themselves or to recommend.

---

## 2. How it works: free platform + packs (1–1.5 min)

**On screen:** Maybe a simple diagram or just you talking to camera.

*“First, how it works. The software itself is free. You get the full platform — planning, calendar, activity library, printing, sharing — all of it. You don’t pay a subscription for the tool.*

*What you can add are **packs** — activity and lesson sets for the things you actually need. So if you’re doing drama, you might buy the **Kneehigh** pack or the **Brecht** pack. If you’re doing music and early years, there are **EYFS**-focused activities and categories. You only buy the packs that fit your curriculum. So it’s free to get going, and you only pay for the content you use.”*

**Mention:**  
- Drama: Commedia dell’arte, Improvisation, Kneehigh, Brecht (KS3 packs).  
- Music / EYFS: built-in categories and EYFS-linked activities; packs can extend that.

## 3. Key features — quick tour (3–4 min)

### 3.1 Activity library & “Build your lesson”

**On screen:** Activity Library, then Build Your Lesson panel.

*“Everything starts from the **activity library**. You’ve got activities by category — things like Kodaly songs, drama games, rhythm, warmups — and you can filter by year group or search.*

*When you’re building a lesson, you pick activities and drag them into your lesson. You see the order, timings, and you can reorder or take things out. So you’re literally building the session in front of you.”*

**Show:** Selecting a few activities, seeing total time, maybe one with video/music/resource links.

---

### 3.2 Calendar & timetable

**On screen:** Main calendar view, then timetable (if you use it).

*“Once you’ve got a lesson, you put it on the **calendar**. You can assign a lesson to a date, or to a class and a time if you’ve set up a **timetable**. So you see the week or the term at a glance — which class has what, when.”*

**Show:** A week with a couple of lessons placed; optionally the timetable setup (classes, days, times).

---

### 3.3 Stacks (optional)

**On screen:** Stacks or “lesson stacks” if you use them.

*“You can also group lessons into **stacks** — like a unit or a topic — and then assign the whole stack to dates or classes. Handy for schemes of work or half-term blocks.”*

(Keep this short if stacks are secondary for your audience.)

---

### 3.4 Print & share

**On screen:** Print lesson / export / share.

*“When you need to share with a colleague or a cover teacher, you can **print** the lesson or **export** it. There’s also a **share** option so you can send a link to the lesson. Everything stays consistent — objectives, timings, links — so whoever’s delivering has the same plan.”*

**Show:** One example: print preview or share dialog.

---

### 3.5 Curriculum: EYFS & custom objectives

**On screen:** An activity or lesson with EYFS / objectives visible.

*“For **EYFS**, activities can be linked to EYFS statements so you see the learning focus. For other year groups, you can set up **custom objectives** — your own curriculum or assessment criteria — and attach those to activities and lessons. So it works for early years and for primary or KS3, depending on how you configure it.”*

**Show:** Either EYFS areas on a lesson/activity or the Custom Objectives area in Settings (briefly).

---

## 4. Customisation — “your brand, your structure” (2–2.5 min)

**On screen:** Settings → open the main tabs.

*“The bit that’s really useful for **providers and training companies** is how much you can customise it. It doesn’t have to look or feel like a generic product.”*

### 4.1 Branding

**On screen:** Settings → Branding (or Admin → Branding).

*“Under **Branding**, you can set your own product name — so it might say your company or project name on the login screen and in the header. You can change the logo letters, colours, footer, and even social links. So when your staff or partners log in, they see your brand, not ours.”*

**Show:** Login title, header, maybe footer.

---

### 4.2 Year groups & classes

**On screen:** Settings → Year groups / Class management.

*“You set up **year groups and classes** to match your setting. So you might have ‘Year 1’ as a heading and under it classes like 1S, 1B, 1D — or Reception, Lower Kindergarten, whatever you use. The rest of the app uses these, so the calendar and filters match your structure.”*

**Show:** List of year groups/bands and classes (if you’ve implemented the bands).

---

### 4.3 Categories & resource links

**On screen:** Settings → Categories, then Resource links (if visible).

*“**Categories** are the activity types — drama games, songs, warmups, etc. You can reorder them, assign them to year groups, and add your own. **Resource links** let you choose what each activity can have — video, music, backing track, PDF, and so on. So the activity cards show exactly the links you care about.”*

**Show:** One category with year groups; one activity with the link types you’ve enabled.

---

### 4.4 Users & access (if relevant)

**On screen:** Settings → Users (if you’re showing an admin/superuser view).

*“If you’re an admin or superuser, you can manage **users** — who has access, their role, and you can send password resets. So it’s manageable for a team or a network of schools or partners.”*

(Only include if your audience cares about multi-user / multi-site.)

---

## 5. Purchases & packs (1 min)

**On screen:** Settings → Purchases (or the purchases page).

*“Back to **packs**. In **Purchases** you see the available card sets and lesson packs. Things like the **Drama Games** pack — lots of activities in one go — or the **KS3 drama practitioner** packs: **Commedia dell’arte**, **Improvisation**, **Kneehigh**, **Brecht**. You buy what you need; the activities then appear in your library and you use them like any other. For music and early years, the platform already has EYFS-friendly categories and you can add more with packs as we release them.”*

**Show:** Two or three pack cards and the “purchase then they appear in your library” idea.

---

## 6. Closing (30–45 sec)

**On screen:** Back to calendar or home, or you to camera.

*“So in short: **free platform**, **pay only for the packs** you want — drama, music, EYFS, whatever fits. You get **full planning, calendar, timetable, print and share**, and you can **customise** branding, year groups, categories, and objectives so it feels like your product. If you’re a provider or a training or resource company, you could use it for your own delivery or recommend it to the people you work with. If you’d like a proper walkthrough or a trial, we can set that up. Thanks for watching.”*

## Tips for recording

- **Relaxed:** Short sentences; pause between ideas. It’s a demo, not a pitch.
- **One idea per clip:** Easier to re-record a 30-second bit than a 5-minute monologue.
- **Show, then say:** “So here’s the calendar…” then do the click. Avoid long explanations before the viewer sees it.
- **Packs:** Emphasise “free software, buy only the packs you need” at least twice (opening + purchases).
- **Customisation:** Emphasise “your brand, your year groups, your categories” so providers see it as white-label-ready.
- **EYFS & music:** One clear example (e.g. one EYFS activity or category) is enough for that audience.
- **Call to action:** End with “walkthrough or trial” so they know the next step.

You can trim or expand any section depending on how long you want the final video (e.g. 6–8 min total with a 1–2 min customisation section).
